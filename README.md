## About

SKKUnite is a web platform prototype designed to help international students at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) in Seoul connect with each other and with Korean students.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Styling:** CSS3, Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Project Context

This is a **prototype/learning project** from 2023 that demonstrates:
- React application development
- Component-based architecture
- Frontend routing and state management
